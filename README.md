# ![Application Icon for Edit](./assets/edit.svg) Edit

A simple editor for simple needs.

This editor pays homage to the classic [MS-DOS Editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS_Editor), but with a modern interface and input controls similar to VS Code. The goal is to provide an accessible editor that even users largely unfamiliar with terminals can easily use.
